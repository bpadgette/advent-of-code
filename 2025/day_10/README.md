> I needed some help on this one.

- Part 1: 
  - My first thought was to build a tree of possible button setting pathways, knowing I need to review my trees,  I went to look for a hint only to see no trees ¯\\(ツ)/¯
  - I once again give credit for this solution to mgtezak for bitmasking + XOR as seen in https://github.com/mgtezak/Advent_of_Code/blob/master/2025/10/p1.py
- Part 2: WIP
